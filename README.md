# HFFST: A Hierarchical Feature Fusion Algorithm for Spatial Gene Expression Prediction using Histopathology Images
We propose HFFST, a hierarchical feature fusion algorithm for predicting spatial gene expression from H\&E-stained pathology images. Leveraging multi-level feature extraction and fusion from whole-slide images, our method employs a coarse-to-fine regression framework to predict spatial transcriptomic profiles. To validate the algorithm's performance, we conducted cross-validation on three public datasets and performed external validation using high-resolution Visium data from 10X Genomics. HFFST has shown promise in predicting spatial gene expression and identifying spatial regions, demonstrating certain advantages over state-of-the-art methods.
